# Quantum-Teleportation-Encryption
Quantum teleportation is a phenomenon in which quantum information (e.g. the state of a particle) can be transmitted from one location to another without physically travelling through the space in between. This is made possible by the principles of quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.
Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it. Quantum encryption, also known as quantum key distribution, uses the principles of quantum physics to transmit encryption keys more securely.
